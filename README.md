# ShapesOnACurve
In order to run this code in Maya, must draw out a curve using the curve tool.  Make sure the curve tool is selected before executing the code.  The program should display a UI, allowing user to decide, with the number slider, how many shapes they want to be created along the curve.  The user gets to decide what type of shapes they want to be created.  Pressing "Generate Shapes" will generate the shapes randomly along the curve that they initially created.

"Change color" allows the user to change each individual shape color that they select.

If the user wants to generate new shapes, they must create a new scene and draw a new curve.
